We achieve this through a set of Projects under the Adoptium\nPMC and a close working partnership with external projects, most notably\nOpenJDK for providing the Java SE runtime implementation. Our goal is to\nmeet the needs of both the Eclipse community and broader runtime users\nby providing a comprehensive set of technologies around runtimes for\nJava applications that operate alongside existing standards,\ninfrastructures, and cloud platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The AdoptOpenJDK project was established in 2017 following years of\ndiscussions about the general lack of an open and reproducible build and\ntest system for OpenJDK source across multiple platforms. Since then it\nhas grown to become a leading provider of high-quality OpenJDK-based\nbinaries used by enterprises in embedded systems, desktops, traditional\nservers, modern cloud platforms, and large mainframes. The Eclipse\nAdoptium project is the continuation of the original AdoptOpenJDK\nmission.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_scope\">Scope</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Eclipse Adoptium provides runtime binaries that are high performance,\nenterprise-caliber, cross-platform, open-source licensed, Java SE\nTCK-tested and compliant for general use across the Java ecosystem.\nEclipse Adoptium also provides artifacts including open-source\ninfrastructure as code, a comprehensive continuous integration build and\ntest farm, and extensive quality assurance tests. These artifacts may be\nused by Eclipse Adoptium projects and other runtime technology builders\nto ensure the provision of secure, Java SE TCK-tested and compliant,\nproduction-ready runtimes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The scope of the project includes developing, managing, promoting, and\nsupporting technologies such as:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Runtimes and Development Kits: supporting the breadth of APIs\nspecified by various versions of Java SE, and available on a wide\nvariety of processor architecture and operating system combinations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TCK Testing Infrastructure: providing infrastructure for running Java\nSE TCKs to ensure compliance and compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JDK Mission Control: low-overhead profiling and diagnostics tools\nsuite for the JVM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Installers and repositories: various mechanisms for obtaining and\nmanaging the installation of runtime technology, such as platform native\ninstallers, container images, download servers, a website, and artifact\nrepositories.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In addition to providing a reliable source of contemporary Java runtime\nbinaries, the Eclipse Adoptium project is a platform for experimentation\nby developers, academics, and researchers. This provides a place to try\nout new runtime, build, test, and infrastructure ideas. Examples of\nprojects that fall under this top-level project include \"jlink.online\"\nfor serving right-sized runtimes to application developers, \"Github\nactions\" to obtain and test with runtimes within Gitâ€™s workflow,\n\"TKG\" the test-kit generation framework, \"Bumblebench\" the\nmicrobenchmarking framework, and more.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_licenses\">License(s)</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Build scripts and other code to produce the binaries, the website and\nother build infrastructure are licensed under <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>OpenJDK code itself is licensed under <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html\">GPL v2 with Classpath Exception</a> (GPLv2+CE) and <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/legal/assembly-exception.html\">GPL v2 with Assembly Exception</a> (GPLv2+Assembly).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","document":{"title":"About Eclipse Adoptium&#174;","main":"About Eclipse Adoptium&#174;"},"fields":{"slug":"/about/","relativePath":"about/index.adoc"},"pageAttributes":{"authors":"gdams, karianna, tellison, parkerm, lasombra, hendrikebbers, davew16, akdsco","based_on":null}},"locales":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"title":"About Eclipse Adoptium&#174;","locale":"en","language":"en","i18n":{"language":"en","languages":["en","en-GB","de","es","fr","zh-CN"],"defaultLanguage":"en","generateDefaultLanguagePage":false,"routed":false,"originalPath":"/about/","path":"/about/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3235583029","764694655"],"slicesMap":{"banner":"banner","footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
