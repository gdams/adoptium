Interestingly Temurin is also a chemical component (also known as Theacrine) that is structurally similar to caffeine but is safer for humans to consume (non-habituating effects). So a small nod to Java as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This is the project and brand name for the binaries that the Eclipse\nFoundation produces.\nWhile we appreciate that the Adoptium/Temurin name split\nis more confusing than just \"Adoptium\", this is similar to how other\nvendors brand their binaries, e.g. Amazon has Corretto, Azul has Zulu\n(and others). The \"Adoptium\" project and working group will deal with\nmore than just Temurin so the distinction is important to maintain.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_what_happened_to_adoptopenjdk\">What happened to AdoptOpenJDK?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The AdoptOpenJDK builds are now known as \"Eclipse Temurin by\nAdoptium\"(<a href=\"https://adoptium.net/blog/2021/08/adoptium-celebrates-first-release/\">read the blog post</a>).\nDon’t worry though - despite the branding changes it is the same open build processes,\nAQAvit test suites and primarily the same team producing them as before, but\nthere are <a href=\"/members\">more larger companies</a> bringing their expertise\nto the working group.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition we have left the old site active, however,\nthe links to latest builds on the old site will now bring you to the\nTemurin builds.

Each Temurin release has passed the relevant Oracle Java Compatibility Kit (JCK)\nto demonstrate that it is a compatible implementation of the Java specification.\nIn addition, Temurin releases must pass the <a href=\"/aqavit\">AQAvit quality verification suite</a>\nto ensure they are ready for production usage. AQAvit tests check the release exhibits\ngreat performance, security, resilience and endurance, and the ability to pass a wide\nvariety of application compatibility tests.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_where_do_i_report_a_bug_or_problem_with_eclipse_temurin\">Where do I report a bug or problem with Eclipse Temurin?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>If you suspect a security vulnerability with any product of the Adoptium project,\nplease send a report to the <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/security/\">Eclipse Security Team</a>\nwho will manage and track the issue privately until it is resolved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Where something is simply not behaving as you expect or you have questions about\nhow to configure Temurin please let us know publicaly by opening a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium-support/issues/new/choose\">support issue</a> and we will\nwork with you to seek a solution. Our support is <a href=\"/support\">\"community support\"</a>\nso problems are addressed on a best effort basis. You should approach organizations\noffering commercial support if you require a guaranteed service-level for your Java\nusage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_can_you_deliver_temurin_with_my_favorite_docker_base_os_image\">Can you deliver Temurin with my favorite Docker base OS image?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We have a set list of variants in our\n<a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin\">official Docker repository</a> to ensure we\nare responsive to the delivery of new images containing Temurin.  Docker collaborates\nwith Adoptium to decide which base operating system container versions they will\nsupport for Temurin.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Users who want a containerized Linux distribution that we don’t provide can follow\nthe instructions in\n<a href=\"https://adoptium.net/blog/2021/08/using-jlink-in-dockerfiles/\">this\nguide</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_my_scanner_reports_a_cve_in_the_eclipse_temurin_docker_image_can_you_fix_it\">My scanner reports a CVE in the Eclipse Temurin Docker image. Can you fix it?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin\">Temurin container images</a> available on\nDocker Hub are <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/\">official images</a>\ncreated and maintained as a collaborative effort between the Adoptium project and\nDocker, Inc. Adoptium creates, maintains, and tests a broad set of\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/containers\">Temurin Dockerfile source files</a> which are\n<a href=\"https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/eclipse-temurin\">used by Docker</a>\nto create official images across various base operating systems.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Docker strives to ensure that the Temurin images contain the most up-to-date packages\navailable within a reasonable time frame. Docker has their own robust vulnerability\nscanning program, however, a third-party security scanner may flag an issue with an\nofficial image. Docker have\n<a href=\"https://github.com/docker-library/faq#why-does-my-security-scanner-show-that-an-image-has-cves\">addressed various reasons</a>\nthis may happen in their FAQ. We are grateful to Docker for continuing to refresh the\nbase images and rebuild the official images on a regular basis.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We are happy to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium-support/issues/new/choose\">receive questions</a>\nabout the\n<a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin\">eclipse-temurin images</a>, but note that\nin some cases we will need to refer the issue to Docker where it relates to the base operating\nsystem.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_will_you_support_my_favorite_architecture_and_operating_system\">Will you support my favorite architecture and operating system?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Eclipse Temurin has the broadest range of platfom support across multiple Java API\nversions. Each new platform incurs further cost and demand on the project&#8217;s\nresources so we constantly review the download and usage demand to ensure we\nare releasing on platforms relevant to a large set of users. The current\nset of platforms we target in our build and test process is listed <a href=\"/supported-platforms\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_why_is_my_favorite_architecture_and_operating_system_no_longer_supported\">Why is my favorite architecture and operating system no longer supported?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The <a href=\"/supported-platforms\">supported-platforms</a> list reflects the intersection of what is supported in the upstream OpenJDK project and what the Adoptium project chooses to build, test and support.  The choice to drop support is determined by a number of criteria, including consumer demand, available funding through sponsorship, resource support for machines, and engineers to help at the project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The most common reason a platform is no longer supported is it&#8217;s deprecation in the upstream OpenJDK project.  For example, in answer to the question \"why is Windows x86 32bit no longer supported in Java 21+?\", one can see <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/449\">JEP 449</a> where that port is deprecated for removal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_can_i_automate_the_download_of_temurin_binaries\">Can I automate the download of Temurin binaries?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Yes! There is a rich <a href=\"https://api.adoptium.net/q/swagger-ui/\">download API</a>\nprovided by Adoptium for downloading Eclipse Temurin builds. Using the API it is\npossible to get information about the latest builds of Temurin, and pull\nthem down into your own application.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We provide\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/api.adoptium.net/blob/main/docs/cookbook.adoc#example-three-scripting-a-download-using-the-adoptium-api\">an example of automating a download</a>\nin the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/api.adoptium.net/blob/main/docs/cookbook.adoc#adoptium-api-cookbook\">Adoptium API cookbook</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_where_are_the_openj9_builds\">Where are the OpenJ9 builds?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The transition to Adoptium means we have unfortunately not been able to\ncontinue to distribute builds of Eclipse OpenJ9. IBM has now taken them\nover and they are now available as\n\"<a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/\">IBM Semeru</a>\".\nThere is no need to be concerned about the change - it is still free.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_why_do_the_packages_not_include_icedtea_web\">Why do the packages not include IcedTea-Web?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The agreements that we have since moving under the Eclipse Foundation\nmean that we can no longer include IcedTea-Web in our installers.\nHowever, you can still add the functionality if you require it using the\n<a href=\"https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2018/10/using-icedtea-web-browser-plug-in-with-adoptopenjdk/\">instructions\nhere</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_can_you_give_a_talk_on_the_project\">Can you give a talk on the project?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The people involved in the project are passionate about promoting it and\nwe are keen to find ways to promote the work we do at Adoptium and with\nthe Temurin binaries so feel free to get in touch with us if you have a\nforum you wish us to participate in and we will see what we can do.
