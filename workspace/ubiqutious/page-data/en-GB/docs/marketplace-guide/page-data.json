The marketplace does not require specific version, platform, usage or license terms, and the binaries available through the marketplace may also be available elsewhere. All binaires offered through the Adoptium marketplace must meet the compatibility and quality criteria defined in the marketplace policy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The marketplace is available to end users as both a\n<a href=\"/marketplace\">website</a>\nand an\n<a href=\"https://marketplace-api.adoptium.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">application programming interface</a>\n(API) hosted and maintained by the Adoptium project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Publishers are encouraged to discuss their participation in the marketplace with the\n<a href=\"/members\">Adoptium Working Group</a>\nwho will provide guidance and assistance with the steps described below. In case of any contradictions between the formal policies and agreements referenced below and this publisher guide, the formal policies and agreements will take precedence.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_preparatory_non_technical_steps\">Preparatory Non-technical Steps</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Potential publishers and their products must meet the criteria described in the\n<a href=\"/marketplace-policy\">Adoptium Marketplace Policy</a>. These criteria include becoming a member of the Adoptium working group at an appropriate level, granting you a voice in the policy and operation of the marketplace. Not every member of the working group will be a publisher. End users are also encouraged to join the working group to help guide the products and requirements of the marketplace products.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Working group members who wish to publish a product in the marketplace must agree to the\n<a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/legal/documents/eclipse-adoptium-marketplace-publisher-agreement.pdf\">Adoptium Marketplace Publisher Agreement</a>. This agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which the Eclipse Foundation accepts your product promotion. Products will benefit from marketing initiatives intended to promote the value of the binaries in this context when accepted into the marketplace.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_publishing_overview\">Publishing Overview</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Adoptium marketplace website and API are driven by metadata that you provide about your eligible products. The metadata is made available by you in\n<a href=\"https://www.json.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JSON</a>\nmachine-readable format, together with a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">secure digital signature</a>\nto ensure the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of the information you publish.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a publisher you are responsible for self-certifying that the information for each product described in the metadata is accurate and adheres to your obligations in the\n<a href=\"/marketplace-policy\">Marketplace Policy</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>You control your products' metadata and the frequency at which it is updated. The Adoptium marketplace application will draw upon that information to market your products, and direct users to download your product directly from a site under your control. Adoptium does not host or distribute your binaries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When a download is initiated via the Adoptium marketplace users will be directed to a post-download page where you can provide a link to additional information about your product, organization, services, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_providing_publisher_information\">Providing Publisher Information</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Publishers must provide the following information in order to be included in the marketplace.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Publisher name : how you would like to be known in the marketplace website and API.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logo image : a visual representation of you as a publisher for use on the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Listing data location : the base URL that Adoptium will use to retrieve your marketplace listing metadata.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Signature public key : the public key we will use to verify your signature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post-download page : the webpage we should direct website users towards when downloading your product.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We don&#8217;t expect you to change these frequently, as Adoptium will be adding these into the marketplace application configuration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The publisher information is provided by opening a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/issues/new/choose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new publisher request issue</a>\nin the Adoptium repository. You can raise a new issue in the same repository if you do subsequently need to change it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_passing_the_oracle_tck_tests\">Passing the Oracle TCK tests</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Every binary you publish via the Adoptium marketplace must fully satisfy all requirements of the then-current TCK for the Java Platform version you are promoting via the Adoptium marketplace. You are responsible for ensuring this has happened before you publish the binary. Adoptium will not check this on your behalf.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Adoptium projects\n<a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.temurin-compliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">develop and use tools</a>\nthat make running and analysing the TCK easier.

You are responsible for ensuring this has happened before you publish the binary. Adoptium will not check this on your behalf.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The\n<a href=\"/aqavit\">AQAvit verification process</a>\nmust be satisfied at the point the binary is initially offered through the marketplace. Publishers are not required to verify the binary to later releases of the AQAvit verification suite. Once a binary meets the criteria it may continue to be offered through the marketplace.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>AQAvit is an open source test suite managed at the Adoptium project. Publishers are welcome to participate in the AQAvit project to get help with the task of running AQAvit on their own products.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_product_listing_information\">Product Listing Information</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Your products listing for the marketplace can be hosted anywhere under your direct control that supports\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTTP</a>\nrequests and responses, including your own website property, GitHub, and so on. While Adoptium will check that the information is received from you securely by using a digital signature based upon verified information, you are ultimately responsible for the information provided to the marketplace via the listing data location URL.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The product listing information comprises structured JSON format files, with flexibility to allow for multiple builds and versions. The information is rooted at the listing data location provided in the <a href=\"#Providing-Publisher-Information\">publisher information</a> in the format described in the\n<a href=\"/docs/marketplace-listing\">Adoptium Marketplace Publisher Product Listing Repository</a>\ndocumentation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The product listing information will be rejected if it does not adhere to the\n<a href=\"/docs/marketplace-listing\">product listing structure</a>,\nmarketplace file schema, or the signature does not verify the content successfully. We will contact you if the listing file is repeatedly failing these validation checks.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_post_download_page\">Post-download page</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>When a user chooses to download your product via the marketplace website they will be directed to a post-download page as the download is initiated from your distribution server.
