## Overview

[AQAvit](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit)
is the quality evaluation project for Java SE runtimes and associated technology. AQAvit takes a functionally complete Java runtime and ensures that all the additional qualities are present that make it suitable for production use. These quality criteria include good performance, exceptional security, resilience and endurance, and the ability to pass a wide variety of application test suites.

## AQAvit Software Product Verification

Eclipse AQAvit tests are made
[available to the public](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit/developer)
at no charge as open source licensed software. You can fork, copy or modify the AQAvit software subject to the terms of the software license.

Nominated [releases of the AQAvit quality verification suite](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/releases) (QVS) are available under the
[Eclipse Foundation Quality Verification Suite License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/documents/eclipse-foundation-quality-verification-suite-license.php)
(QVSL). A software product will be deemed to be “verified” by the AQAvit QVS if it fully and completely meets and satisfies all requirements of the AQAvit QVS as described in the QVSL.

It is not necessary to be an Adoptium working group member to produce an AQAvit verified software product.
