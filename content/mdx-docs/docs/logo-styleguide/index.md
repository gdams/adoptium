None of the 2 is preferred and you should always use the one that fits best to the given layout.

### Color Variants

Next to the landscape and portrait mode the logo is provided in 3 different color variants: coloured, grayscale, black&white. For each of the variants you can find different versions to use the logo always with a good contrast to the background.
