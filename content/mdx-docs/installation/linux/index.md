Eclipse Temurin RPM and DEB packages are now available for installing on your favourite Linux distribution.

> See [Supported Platforms](/supported-platforms) for a list of our officially supported installers by Linux distribution / version. Other Linux distributions / versions are supported on a best effort basis.

> On most Linux systems you must have superuser privileges to install packages such as Temurin. You may need to prefix the commands below with `sudo` for them to succeed.

## Eclipse Temurin Package Names

The following name schema is being used:

```text
temurin-<version>-jdk
e.g temurin-17-jdk or temurin-8-jdk
```

## Deb installation on Debian or Ubuntu

Ensure the necessary packages are present:

```bash
apt install -y wget apt-transport-https
```

Download the Eclipse Adoptium GPG key:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
```

Configure the Eclipse Adoptium apt repository. To check the full list of versions supported take a look at the list in the tree at https://packages.adoptium.net/ui/native/deb/dists/.

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
