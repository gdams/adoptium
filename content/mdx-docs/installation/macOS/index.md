Eclipse Temurin macOS installer packages are available as standard .pkg
files, which can be run with an interactive user interface or run
silently from the Terminal command line.

## GUI installation

installer:

1. [Download](/temurin/releases) the `.pkg` file.
1. Navigate to the folder that contains the file and open it to launch
the installation program or drag the icon to your Application folder.
1. The Introduction screen indicates the target location for the
installation, which you can change later in the install process. Click
Continue.
1. Read the license, click Continue and accept the license if you are
happy with the terms.
1. Change the target location for the installation. Click Install to
complete the installation.

## Command-line installation

user interaction, which can be useful for widescale deployment. You must
have administrator privileges. Follow these steps:

1. Launch the Terminal app (`terminal.app`).
1. Run the following command:

```bash
installer -pkg <path_to_pkg>/<pkg_name>.pkg -target /
```

1. Enter the Administrator password
1. Temurin installs to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-<version>.<jdk|jre>/`
