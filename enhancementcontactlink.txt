According to me we should place the "want to join" button at the starting of the webpage rather than,
at the end as the user would have to scroll all the way down unlike the  way as the Eclipse foundation page is designed.
We can have two button placed side-by-side one of "want to join" and the other should be about the contact for the membership. 
These should be at the top of the page just like that of the page of The Eclipse Foundation. 
For the "want to sponsor" we can place that one at the end of the webpage. 
This can be the improvements over the current format.
